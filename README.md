# LLMForge Protocol

LLMForge introduces a conceptual framework for supervised AI-assisted
software development.  
It formalizes how language models, CI/CD pipelines and human validation
can cooperate under a shared versioned protocol.

### Vision

LLMForge explores a new way for artificial intelligence and developers to collaborate.

Instead of treating language models as black-box code generators,
LLMForge defines a disciplined environment where every task is described,
versioned, and verified.

It is not a tool or a framework,  
but a **philosophy of supervised AI development** —  
where creativity remains human and precision becomes shared.

### Core Principles

- Every action is traceable.  
- Automation never replaces validation.  
- Human review remains the final authority.  
- Structure enables creativity, not the opposite.

---

### Purpose

The LLMForge protocol aims to create a common language between
humans, AIs, and DevOps pipelines.

No implementation details or internal scripts are published here.  
This repository serves purely as a **conceptual and philosophical reference**
for the research community.
